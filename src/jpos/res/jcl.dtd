<!-- 
     This is the DTD for all JCL (JavaPOS Config/Loader) entries.  It defines
     the content necessary for all JCL entries in their XML file.  Please see the
     example XML files in the release as well as the JCL documentation for details
     on how to create your own XML files that are valid for this DTD.  You may also
     use the JCL editor to create these files, as long as the JCL instalation is 
     setup for XML (instead of serialized or CFG).

<!-- NOTE on the type attribute.  
     This was added after the first release and therefore to maintain 
     compatibility, it is defined as #IMPLIED so that it does not need 
     to be specified and the default type for attributes with no type
     is String.  for instance:
               <prop name="propName" value="1234"/> 
     is of type String and the "1234" value is kept as a String in the
     JposEntry.  If you want the "1234" to be converted to an integer 
     for instance then you must use the type attribute as follow:
               <prop name="propName" value="1234" type="Integer"/>
